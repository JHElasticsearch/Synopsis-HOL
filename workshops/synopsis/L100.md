# Background Challenges for Synopsis

In this lab you will assume the role of Manager of Sales Paolo Rodney. Paolo needs to travel across all of his regions to help close deals. He needs to know where he needs to focus his time and maximize his travel.

He just received Sales spreadsheet from his corporate office.  This is about the only report they generate for him that provides much value.  Unfortunately, every time he receives it, he manually scans through the numbers trying to create reports and charts in Excel that are useful.  
He has just boarded a train on his way to a sales office in one of his territories and he has an hour or so to kill.  he is going to use this time to try out the Synopsis product, specifically looking for two things:
1)	Focus on Sales & Profit of North America Region 
2)	See who (Sales Rep) needs the most help in which City and for which Customer Segment and Product Category.
