Start your day with a smart list of analytics that helps you make better decisions—day by day. Let us show you how to infuse analytics into people’s lives and not the other way around.

# Lab 100: Provisioning and Getting Started

## Lab Introduction

You will assume the role of Sales Manager Chris Nolan. Chris needs to travel across all of his regions to help close deals. He needs to know where to focus his time and maximize his travel.

Oracle Day by Day is a part of OAC - Enterprise Edition Offering. Hence a OAC Account needs to be provisioned to enable using Oracle Day by Day.

This lab walks you through the steps to provision a new Autonomous Analytic Cloud service. Note throughout all the labs you may see small differences between what you see in your accounts and the results of various steps due to cloud product updates. 

To log issues and view the Lab Guide source, go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/JHGithubRep/Synopsis-HOL/blob/master/workshops/synopsis) repository.

## Objectives
-   Learn how to provision an Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service

## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

# Steps

## Provisioning an Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service
In this section you will be provisioning an Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service using the cloud console.

### **STEP 1: Sign in to Oracle Cloud**
- Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com), click `Sign In` to sign in with your Oracle Cloud account.

### **STEP 2: Initiate the creation of an Autonomous Analytic Cloud service.  Note this will take approximately two hours.**

- Click on `My Services` to go to your Dashboard (if you are not already there).  Select `Compute`.  You may need to select `Customize Dashboard` if you do not see `Compute`.

# Conclusion
Chris Nolan found that creating a new Autonomous Analytic Cloud service is very very easy, and took only a couple of minutes to create.

You can now move on to the next lab.
